## About

Hi, my name is Cássio Fernando. I'm a Fullstack developer based on Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. The goal of this website is to be my personal blog and portfolio.

## Features

This website has all the same features from LoveIt, my favorites are:

- Bultin markdown blog system
- Bultin analytics system
- Bultin comment system
- Bultin image processing
- Bultin latex support
- Bultin custom player

## Usage

You will need git and hugo installed, from your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cassiofb-dev/cassio-fernando

cd cassio-fernando

hugo server
```

## [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

With the advent of this amazing AI, I'll generate blog post with it. The author will be ChatGPT itself, steps to train the model:

1. Write a markdown code block with blog post about something
2. At the start write this filling the empty fields:
    ```md
    ---
    author: "ChatGPT"
    authorLink: "https://openai.com/"

    title: ""
    description: ""

    tags: [""]
    categories: [""]

    resources:
    - name: "featured-image"
      src: "featured-image.png"
    ---
    ```
