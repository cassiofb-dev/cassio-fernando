Baking a cake can be a daunting task, but with a few simple steps, you can create a delicious and beautiful dessert that will impress your friends and family. In this post, we'll go over the basics of baking a cake, including ingredients, equipment, and techniques.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and flour your cake pan.

3. In a separate mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix well. Stir in the vanilla extract.
4. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth out the top.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
