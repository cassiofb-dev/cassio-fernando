## Top Five Boss Battles

Hi guys, Cassio's here!
Today I'll share my personal most epic boss battles my criterias will be:

- Soundtrack
- Gameplay
- Plot

The pontuation scheme is as follow:

1. Bad
2. Okay
3. Good
4. Awesome
5. Masterpiece

Be aware of the spoilers in plot session, hope you guys love it!

### 05: Scaramouche (11/15)

{{< figure src="scaramouche.webp" title="Scaramouche" >}}

#### Soundtrack 5/5

{{< youtube 3MRH8jeTpPk >}}

With an amazing opera and orchestra his battle theme will be marked on people memories. The gameplay helps the music as the boss can't be bursted quickly.

{{< admonition type=note title="Quick note" open=false >}}

In Genshin Impact we have two other bosses (Tartaglia and La Signora). They also have amazing soundtracks but if a player is on late game they can be killed in no time making all the awesome tracks wasted ðŸ˜¢

#### Gameplay 4/5

{{< youtube ffUzDIKigP4 >}}

His battle have 2 phases, the animations and voice lines of both are amazing! The cold bucket is that even though the other Fatui battle also have transformations we will never fight Scara on his default and hyped form, only the big robot. In terms of difficulty it's not a hard battle and a player with late game items can handle him just fine.

#### Plot 2/5

{{< admonition type=danger title="Spoiler Alert" open=false >}}

Now it's the controversial part. As I mentioned in gameplay, Scaramouche always was a hyped character because of his body shape and remarkable clothes. He is the 6th Fatui too making him a strong one in his base form. But when we finally comfront him on Sumeru we got a giant robot and a misarable guy that even the kindest God let him fall with the head straight to the floor ðŸ˜¢. I have a feeling that even though he is the main character of this battle the focus is always on Nahida and Dottore making him appear like a side character.

### 04: Azhdaha (12/15)

{{< figure src="azhdaha.webp" title="Azhdaha" >}}

#### Soundtrack 5/5

{{< music netease song 1861578699 >}}

{{< music netease song 1861578703 >}}

With an opera and orchestral part too but with a chinese flavor, this track is amazing and epic! Here we don't have the problem of a strong player bursting the boss because this dog have 3 phases with awesome animations transformations.

#### Gameplay 4/5

{{< youtube ajC0GG8mbmA >}}

As said, this guy can't be destroyed on a single shot so even a godly player will have wait his animations and track for some time. The difficult is there, if you don't dodge his attacks and don't bring a shield character make sure you have a flower for your character grave. Overall if you aren't angry because you died too much it's a good experience battling it.

#### Plot 3/5

{{< admonition type=danger title="Spoiler Alert" open=false >}}

This big boy here is older than the oldest Archon. Morax (the oldest Archon) said:

> I do not pretend to match your rhetoric when it comes to the subject of a life long-lived. I fear that the life of an elemental being is longer than any in this world.

It's story with Morax is a happy one with a tragic end. Being a Elemental Being and probably one of the Seven Soverign, Azhdaha is his prime was stronger than even the Seven Archons together. The Soverigns were defeated by the primordial one, an entity from another world that descend in Teyvat to create the human realm. But time waits for no one as Azhdaha was corrupted by erosion and Morax, his previous companion, had to battle and imprison him for a long time.

### 03: Sans (13/15)

{{< figure src="sans.webp" title="Sans" >}}

#### Soundtrack 4/5

{{< music netease song 39224659 >}}

This battle theme is like the boss, surprising and unexpected. Though it doesn't have the super production and team from the previous themes discussed it's awesome anyway. You will sure will have a good time listening this song.

#### Gameplay 5/5

{{< youtube Vr4IYjeplJA >}}

Undertale has a unique and magic gameplay, mixing RPG and bullet hell you won't have the same experience with the enemies on this game. Sans gameplay is at first surprising and intimidating, it doesn't matter how easily you beat the other bosses he will make it a player slaughterhouse. But it's amazing that even though it's really difficult with the time you will overcome it.

#### Plot 4/5

{{< admonition type=danger title="Spoiler Alert" open=false >}}

What to say about it? Undertale is a game with different ends and this one you will have to be a serial killer to complete the genocide route. At the end of it, awaits a character that is funny and seems lazy but it's a real player slaughter. A suprise players will find is that Sans is aware of the players death and when the player travels back in time in a save point.

{{< /admonition >}}

### 02: Magus (13/15)

#### Soundtrack 4/5

{{< youtube bZ0s54CRdOo >}}

As an old RPG battle, Magus battle theme has an awesome soundtrack that brings player to Chrono Trigger universe. Not much too comment just a really good classic RPG track.

#### Gameplay 4/5

{{< youtube 1Dyw5hvMeUU >}}

One of the strong points of the whole game is the gameplay. An awesome mechanic of this game is the comabat system, where you can unlock different combos with different characters, the fight is a turn battle with timing and the battle is on the same scene as the map so you won't will switch to a 2D background.

#### Plot 5/5

{{< admonition type=danger title="Spoiler Alert" open=false >}}

Another strong point of this game! While you travel back and foward on time and do a lot of quests you will encounter a future civilization and a ancient civilization. Betrayed by his mother and losing his sister, Magus became a demon lord that will seek vengeance from Lavos (Culprit). At the end of the battle the player can decide if Magus will be spared or not and if he will join the party, this will affect the game plotline but all of them are amazing on its way.

### 01: Red (14/15)

{{< figure src="red.webp" title="Trainer Red" >}}

#### Soundtrack 4/5

{{< youtube Jxk9DqdYsJ4 >}}

It's a good classic RPG track, being on the same category as the battle before. This one though is strange because the first time hearing it's not that awesome but as you keep battling Red you won't be able to forget it.

#### Gameplay 5/5

{{< youtube Jpdy9pZyGH4 >}}

Red is the strongest trainer of the pokemon series and you can feel it in the battle. One will have to be prepared to a scare because of the gap between him and the champion. I think this is a masterpiece because different from others pokemon games, you will have to win twice the challengers in order to fight Red. And even will all this experience you will have a though one and besides farming you will need to revise your strategy.


#### Plot 5/5

{{< admonition type=danger title="Spoiler Alert" open=false >}}

Sometime you can wonder why is that guy so strong, why he is at the top of Mt. Silver, who is Red? Red is the represatation of the player and all your choices. This character makes an oustanding job on being the player, you will be happy and proud fighting him on Mt. Silver. Hats Off to Gamefreak on this game.
