## Why Hugo?

My first blog was developed with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)) and it was a good experience. But I built it because I wished to learn more about these stacks, so I even didn't use a framework for style (like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) and coded a lot of things that I could have reused from the community. Now I'm doing a new personal website and blog with a tool made for it with a lot of features.

## The Beginning

The first thing I did was of course search for a tool to build a blog, I wanted to do it with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) (another [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework) but as I did a lot of things with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and worked [Angular](https://angular.io/) (a similar framework) I wished to learn something new and more focused on blog development, so I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The next thing I did was read the docs and soon I found about the community themes. This way I found about LoveIt theme and start to love all the features that were included in it. So for a quickstart I just cloned the theme repo and started the example site provided by them. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is such a simple tool that in no time at all I started playing with it! After the initial project config I started write this post and then I will import all the posts from [my previous site](https://cassiofernando.netlify.app/) to this new one!
